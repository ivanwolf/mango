# Mango

Mango is a simple react starter kit. It features Webpack, Babel, Eslint and Flow.

Bulma for the styles and Redux is in the mix also.

## TODO

- [x] Minimal setup
- [ ] Build script
- [ ] Test support

## Motivation

I create this project because I wanted to know whats is happenning behind the scenes in others react starters kits such as [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
